Training at STMicroelectronics - Computer Arithmetic
Welcome to my repository documenting the Computer Arithmetic training conducted at STMicroelectronics. This repository contains Verilog RTL implementations of various adders and multipliers, showcasing fundamental concepts in digital design.

Adders
Brent Kung Adders
8-bit Brent Kung Adder

File: 8bit_brent_kung_adder.v

Description: Implements an 8-bit adder using the Brent Kung algorithm.

64-bit N-bit Brent Kung Adder

File: 64bit_Nbit_brent_kung_adder.v

Description: Implements a scalable N-bit adder (specifically 64-bit) using the Brent Kung algorithm.

Usage
Each adder module can be instantiated in your design by including the respective Verilog files.

Multipliers
Multiplier Types
Shift Right Multiplier

File: shift_right_multiplier.v

Description: Implements a multiplier using the shift-right method.

Radix-8 Multiplier

File: radix8_multiplier.v

Description: Implements a multiplier using the radix-8 algorithm.

Array Multiplier

File: array_multiplier.v

Description: Implements a multiplier using an array-based approach.

Usage
Each multiplier module provides different implementations suited for various design requirements.

Getting Started
Clone the repository to your local machine.

Integrate the adders and multipliers into your Verilog projects as needed.
